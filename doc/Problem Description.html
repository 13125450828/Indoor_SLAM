    <h1>Indoor SLAM</h1>
    <p>The goal of this project is to utilize SLAM (Simultaneous Localization And Mapping) to build a map of the world around a ground vehicle. The vehicle would use distance finding sensor(s), e.g. ultrasonic or laser range finders, to both build the map and aid in localization. There are two measures of success that would judge the vehicle. 1) Placed in an unknown environment, can a map representative of the environment be obtained. 2) Placed in a known environment (provided a map) with an unknown location, can the robot indicate it has reached a goal position proving it has properly found it's location in the environment. The second goal would also implement some path search algorithm to reach the goal location once it has a strong enough belief about it's location.</p>
