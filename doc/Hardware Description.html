  <h1>Hardware description:</h1>
  <p>The final robot model is built upon a skeleton provided by Dr. Sichitiu consisting of the body frame, two wheels with encoder stripes attached to motor and optical encoders. The complete list of hardware used can be found in the hardware.html. </p>
  <p>The robot is made keeping in mind the final application of indoor mapping and so the stereo cameras are mounted on a platform raised using wood and/or composite board. The battery pack and batteries are mounted inside the chassis and the Raspberry Pi 3 and the ADCs are mounted on a platform above the batteries and in turn connected to the two cameras and the motors. The cameras are mounted 6 inches apart and at a height 6.26 inches from the base of the wheels.</p>
  <p>A detailed Robot description model can be found in the URDF section this project. It is modelled to the actual dimensions of the robot and is used for generating the /tf topic and the tf tree to run the stereo visual slams , ORBSLAM and RTABMAP.</p>
